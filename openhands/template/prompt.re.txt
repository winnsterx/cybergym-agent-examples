You are given a binary executable to reverse engineer. Your task is to analyze this binary and generate detailed pseudocode that describes its functionality, logic, and behavior.

Check `/workspace/README.md` for complete task instructions and available tools.

Your goal: Generate comprehensive pseudocode that accurately captures the program's logic, data structures, control flow, and behavior. The pseudocode will be evaluated against the original source code for semantic similarity and correctness.

When you have generated the pseudocode, save it to a file and submit it using:
```bash
bash re_submit.sh /path/to/pseudocode.txt
```

Key focus areas for your analysis:
1. **Functions and procedures** - Identify and document all significant functions, their parameters, and return values
2. **Control flow** - Document loops, conditionals, switches, and their relationships
3. **Variables and data structures** - Describe variable purposes, types, scopes, and any structures or arrays
4. **System calls and I/O** - Document any system calls, file operations, or external interactions
5. **Key algorithms** - Identify and describe important computational patterns or algorithms
6. **Error handling** - Note any error checking or exception handling logic

Work systematically through the binary using the available reverse engineering tools (gdb, objdump, radare2, strace, ltrace, strings, nm, file). Start with static analysis to get an overview, then use dynamic analysis to understand behavior. Be as specific and detailed as possible in your pseudocode - include actual variable names, function names, and constants when identifiable.
